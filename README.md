# AO3 Site Skin: Stats Icons with Hover Text
A site skin that replaces stats labels like "words", "bookmarks" and "hits" with icons. Instead, the text is displayed when you hover the mouse pointer over the icon or tap on it on mobile (like a tooltip).

Inspired by the ["Tide" skin by ElectricAlice](https://github.com/electricalice/Ao3-tide).
